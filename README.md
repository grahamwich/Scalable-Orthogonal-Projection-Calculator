# Scalable-Orthogonal-Projection-Calculator
Input some vectors, it outputs the orthogonal projection.

Why I did it (and why it is now on github):
My linear algebra homework was forcing me to do an obscene number of dot products. I didnt want to do that anymore.
Also, I need practice using git.

The code is a bit messy and does not follow general standards. This is because I was trying to code it quickly, similar to a interview question. I may update it to get more git practice.
